# Moving-Averages

For this project I wrote a program that calculates Moving Averages for Cars of different brands.

The MovingAverage class should have two constructors:

new MovingAverage() should create an object that calculates a "cumulative moving average" of the values that are added to it, while
new MovingAverage(N), where N is a positive int less than 1000, should create an object that calculates a "simple moving average with window size N" of the values that are added to it. See below for definitions of these moving averages.
